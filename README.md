# AngularApiTest

This is a test project to demonstrate some front end software development. It uses the [CoinCap API](https://docs.coincap.io/) and displays data on the various crypto currencies. It makes use of [Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home) and [ng2-charts](https://valor-software.com/ng2-charts/) for displaying the detail in a more pleasing way.

When you start the local server, click on the "About" nav tab for more information.
